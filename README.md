#Introduction
Isaac's Grimoire is a real-time cheat sheet for The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth.

It will read the game's memory and automatically display every items' usage.
I hope it can save player from searching item in cheat sheet and memorizing pill
effects in every run.

**Note**: If you have not tasted a pill, the app will not show its effect.

If you are under the blind curse, the collectibles' info will be hidden, too.

#Cheat Table
I found most of the Mac version's address with Bit-Slicer. When I was writting
windows version, Cheat Engine helped a lot.

#Dependences
* Qt5
* Visual Studio 2015
